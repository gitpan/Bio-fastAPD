Bio::fastAPD v1.00

The Bio::fastAPD module provides computationally efficient methods for the calculation of 
average pairwise difference (APD), a measure of nucleotide diversity, from multiple 
sequence alignment (MSA) data. The module also provides rapid standard error estimation
of the APD using an efficient jackknife resampling method. Further description of the
methods implemented in this module, including mathematical justification, will be
available in an upcoming peer-reviewed journal article.
